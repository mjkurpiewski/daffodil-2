# daffodil-2 v0.0.6

A collection of programs, written in Clojure, designed to efficiently find solutions to
Project Euler exercises. The current version number (i.e. 0.0.3) reflects the problem that
I am currently working. As the number increases, the tens place will occupy the second
versioning digit. (i.e. version 0.1.1 would reflect working on exercise 11.)

## Current status
* Problem 1: Complete
* Problem 2: Complete
* Problem 3: "Just one more thing!" away from completion, see header comments in problem3.clj for a description of the project and its progress.
* Problem 4: Complete
* Problem 5: Complete
* Problem 6: Complete
* Problem 7: Pending

## Usage

Look at the code, play with it in a REPL, try to break things, whatever your heart
desires. I try to thorougly document all functions I write, so if you happen to find
the clarity or accuracy of my docstrings lacking, please let me know! I appreciate
constructive feedback and criticism.
