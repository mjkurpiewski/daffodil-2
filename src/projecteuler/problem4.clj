;; Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

;; For posterity, I elected to save the different iterations that my predicate
;; for ascertaining whether a number was palindromic, mainly because I think it's
;; kind of interesting how one approaches the idea of what a palindrome is, either
;; something that reads the same front-to-back as back-to-front, (which would imply
;; the vastly more simple string reversal solution) or whether or not that the two
;; halves are mirror images of each other (kind of represented by my first function,
;; on lines 17-37.) thanks to alligator and gizmo for their thoughtful insights as
;; I wrote this solution.

;;   "This function takes an integer of indeterminant size and will return true if
;;   the number is a palindrome, false otherwise. The function operates by converting
;;   our target integer to a string, splitting the string in half, if it is even.
;;   Otherwise, we will select the center element and discard it in the odd case,
;;   splitting it in to (1 .. (p - 1)) and ((p + 1) .. n), where p is the pivot
;;   or center element.

;;   In either case, armed with our two substrings of equal length, we can reverse
;;   either of the two substrings and then perform a test for equality. If both substrings
;;   are equal after the reversal of one, our number is palindromic and our work is done.
